# Disaster Ready :fire:

### Disaster Ready is an experimental project developed for the [NASA SpaceApps Competition](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/):rocket:

It's a web app that takes your current location and displays:
* The most frequent type of disaster from your area
* How much time passed since it happened
* A colored dot representing how safe the area is

Also you have 3 buttons:
* I want to learn -> where you can read about what important items to have in your supply kit
* I want to help -> where you can help those in need with donations and more
* I need help -> where you can request help, if you are in a dangerous situation

We used:
* Firebase
* [ReliefWeb Api](https://reliefweb.int/help/api):heart:

### Instructions:
***
```
1. npm install
2. npm start
